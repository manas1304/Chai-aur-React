<a> tag is not used in major project since it triggers a refresh 
so if the page has to reload then whole structure, DOM, html, css and everything will be painted again
so then there wouldn't be any use of react for that functionality 
since react makes sure only the changes are reloaded and the rest of the component stays the same.
